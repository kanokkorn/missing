Memory
------

ELIM5 for computer memory from application to silicon 

words
-----

virtual address space  (vas)	fake address for application, processes
memory management unit (mmu)	Part of CPU, mapping virtual address space to a physical memory (RAM, disk)


virtual address space
---------------------

a fake memory adress for application data section for whatever data is, like parameters, function ... etc 

why fake address ? imagine a silly program that does nothing but a memory allocation. that could crash entire system.
vas prevent that by provide them fake memory address, so they can have many address as they wanted

           0                                           4 GiB
VAS        |---vvv--------vvvvvv---vvvv----vv---v----vvv--|
mapping        |||        ||||||   ||||    ||   |    |||
file bytes     app        kernel   user   system_page_file

		example of vas with 4 GiB of RAM

when vas know there's an actual data in the address, 


translate from virtual to physical
----------------------------------

Things to know before translate is

- Page size
- bits of virtual address

In this example: 16-bit system, 4KB page size and physical memory size is 64KB.

log2(page_size) -> log2(4096) = 12 bit offset
