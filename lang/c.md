# C/C++

## Ternary Ops

Same as if-else statement but shorter and only supported 1 condition

Normally we would write if-else statement like this

```c
if (condition) {
  expression 1;
} else {
  expression 2;
}
```

But with Ternary Ops we could write

```c
condition ? expression 1 : expression 2;
```

## Elvis Ops

Like ternary ops but with 2 condition

From

```c
condition ? expression 1 : expression 2;
```

## Scanset

## Case range
